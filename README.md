# What is this?

This an example of how to develop a table view controller subclass using TDD. I used a prior version of this (Swift 2.3) for my talk at the Command+U Conference (http://www.cmduconf.com/).  This is the updated version for Swift 3. There are commits for every test, so I hope this is useful.

# What can I do with it?

Sell it for $10M and share the benefits with me. :-) Otherwise it should be a learning example. Enjoy it!
